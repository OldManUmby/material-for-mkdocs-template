Welcome! This demo site was created using a [Material for MkDocs GitHub Template](https://github.com/OldManUmby/material-for-mkdocs-template). Duplicating this site is easy with FREE hosting provided by [GitHub](https://github.com), visit the [template page](https://github.com/OldManUmby/material-for-mkdocs-template) and click "Use this Template".

[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) is a powerful [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) documentation framework on top of [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org), a static site generator for project documentation. This demo site is an installation of Material for MkDocs, complete with many of the most useful YML settings.

I've set up this site as a template specifically for the laymen. Visit the [Material for MkDocs GitHub Template](https://github.com/OldManUmby/material-for-mkdocs-template) GitHub repo and click the green button "Use this Template" to create a new documentation repo complete with GitHub Pages. It takes less than a few minutes! Then, add a domain (optional) and begin adding your markdown docs as pages to the site.

To customize the site, adjust the mkdocs.yml file to suit your needs; for more info on customizing the site, visit [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).
