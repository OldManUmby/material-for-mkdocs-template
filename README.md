# Material for MkDocs Template

[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) is a powerful [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) documentation framework on top of [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org), a static site generator for project documentation. This GitHub repo is a complete installation of Material for MkDocs, complete with many of the most useful YML settings.

I've set up this repo as a template specifically for the laymen. Click the green button "Use this Template" above to create a new documentation repo complete with GitHub Pages. It takes less than a few minutes! Then, add a domain (optional) and begin adding your markdown docs.

To view a more thorough step-by-step installation, including a running local instances, visit [James Willitt's YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Q-YA_dA8C20?si=l00iX2nvDRIFSwOb).

To customize the site, adjust the mkdocs.yml file to suit your needs; for more info on customizing the site, visit [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).
